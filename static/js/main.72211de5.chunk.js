It just has it all!(except lust\ud83d\ude09).<br /><br /> I recommend reading "The Hobbit" before you read LOTR, it will help you understand some of the details mentioned in this story. I, however, had no idea about its existence until much later, when I was flipping through the rest of the book.<br /> <br /><br /> There are a large number of other books which relate to the history of "Middle Earth", its inhabitants and their history as well. To list a few:<br />1. The Silmarillion<br />2. Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth<br />3. The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book <br /><br />The film adaptations by Peter Jackson do good justice to the books, unlike most other stories.<br /><br /> Read this if you have the patience to read ~1000 pages, along with a love for fantasy fiction!<br/>',id:"1",path:"/resources/books/LOTR.jpg"},{bookName:"The Harry Potter Series",authorName:"Joanne K.

I would <i>definitely</i> recommend the books over the movies if you have the patience to read.<br /><br /> The Fantastic Beasts series though, is nice. The movies differ from the book (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them) by a wide margin. These movies are the prequels to the HP series (meant to be watched after the HP series, of course).

I don't particularly like this series, it's very monotonous and lacklustre after the Percy Jackson series.

However, I had to undergo an operation soon after I finished reading the first book, Eragon. I read the other two books, while recovering (Inheritance hadn't released yet). I grew a deep attachment for these books, while recovering from the operation. They made me forget everything. I was utterly swallowed in \"Alagaesia\", the world on which the story is based upon. This was of course before I had read The Lord Of the Rings, so I had no idea about the resemblances between the two series. Even so, the Inheritance cycle holds a special place in my heart, for being my companion when I really needed.<br /><br />The story is pretty good, you can definitely give it a try, if you have time to spare. Despite its slight resemblances to the LOTR series, the content is entirely is original and new.
