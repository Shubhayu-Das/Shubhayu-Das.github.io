			"content": "Hey there! This website is currently under development. I have a plethora of changes coming up in the future.<br /><br /> The preceding blog page will have a lot of improvements regarding its appearance. I would like to add tags to each of the posts so that it's easier to identify.<br /><br /> The certificates page will be modified to include my skills as well.<br /><br /> I would like to lazy load the images on the books read page, because there are so many out there now, that opening the page takes some serious amount of network time.<br /><br /> After all this, I would like to convert all the blogs, books read and project description into markdown files. They are far more convenient to make and look better on rendering. As of June, 2019, I couldn't find a proper react module for parsing Markdown files.<br /><br /> If you have used any in your own projects, <i>please</i> let me know! ",

Damn even the first two sentences weren't enough to overflow a large screen. The third and fourth sentences will definitely do it :-) ",
