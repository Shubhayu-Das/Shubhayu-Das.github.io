			"description": "Communicating all the students in one's tuition classes can be hard sometimes. Its hard to use social media apps like Whatsapp. My friend came up with the to build a general website to do just that. With features like tracking fees status, send messages to selected students and upload necessary files onto the website; this website is going to make life much simpler for students and the teachers. The website is mobile friendly as well.",

			"description": "This one is not my brainchild. I have, however, contributed a good part for this project under GirlScriptSummer of Code 2019. It's a JS library to provide functions and features which specifically help in competitive programming(Can be used otherwise as well). The owner of this repository is Priyabrata Biswas. Check out the project at the link given below! Its a pretty interesting idea, given the conveniences which JavaScript provides.",

			"description": "This is one of my first programs in JavaScript. It's a logically correct simulation of 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. While the controls are hard to use, and the animations somewhat awkward, I made it from scratch using plain curve equations. By the way, this one got me into the coding club at college😄.",

			"name": "Notes manager using Dropbox",
			"description": "This is one of my experiments with APIs. It's just a simple wrapper for the Dropbox API in JavaScript.<br />I have structured it to load all the folders that exist in my Dropbox account. As of now, I can upload and download files as per my convenience in any of the folders that I want to. <br />This is probably going to be a part of my student helper app. I am currently working on authentication and deleting files.<br />Any suggestions for improvements are more than welcome",
